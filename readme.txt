Add extra data to your Easy Digital Downloads products! Indicate if the product is available in the WordPress plugin repository and more.


== Description ==

**This plugin requires [Easy Digital Downloads](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/). It allows you to add post meta data in Easy Digital Downloads to indicate a third party product as well as a link for more information. Also, it adds a checkbox to indicate if the download is available in the WordPress plugin repository.** 

***Please Note:** The plugin doesn't really do anything on it's own. It is for advanced users and does nothing on the front-end without writing your own custom code.*   

= Here is what it does do: =  

1. Adds a checkbox to the download configuration for you to indicate that a product is from a third party.
2. Adds another checkbox to indicate that a product is available on the WordPress plugin repository.
3. Adds a URL field for you to add an external link to a blog or website for product details or more information.
4. Stores this data in the download product's post_meta data for you to access and use in your custom code.

= Example of how to call the data in your code: =

    if(get_post_meta( $post_id, 'edd_third_party', true )) {

        echo 'This item is from a third party.' ;

    }
    
    if(get_post_meta( $post_id, 'edd_wp_plugin', true )) {

        echo 'This item can be downloaded from WordPress.' ;

    }
    
    if(get_post_meta( $post_id, 'edd_bloglink_url', true )) {

        $bloglink = get_post_meta( $post_id, 'edd_bloglink_url', true );
        echo `<a href="' .$bloglink. '" target="_blank">Click for Details </a>`;

    }

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**How do I add this to my code?**

First, see PHP code examples provided under the description, or visit the plugin's blog page: http://butlerconsulting.com/work/plugins/edd-thirdparty-bloglink/ for further details and examples. 

Second, if you really have to ask that question, the plugin is probably not for you. This plugin was designed to expand the dataset of Easy Digital Downloads via custom post meta fields and then accessed through custom code within your theme or `functions.php` file. 


== Upgrade Notice ==

The current version is 1.0 and represents the initial release.


== Screenshots ==

1. A screenshot of the fields that this plugin adds to the "Download Prices" post metabox.

2. Example usage for code.  In this case, if "edd_third_party" returns true, I display the third-party badge. If "edd_wp_plugin" returns true, I add the "FREE Download" text and the WordPress FontAwesome icon to the button.

3. Second example usage for code.  In this case, I am also using the free [External Products](https://easydigitaldownloads.com/extensions/external-products/) plugin in conjunction with my own.  This enables me to have two links, one for the file download and one for the "View Details" link.


== Credits and Special Thanks ==


Of course a big "shout out" must be given to Matt Mullenweg and the WordPress team for making the entire world possible! Also, of course, kudos to [Pippin Williamson](http://pippinsplugins.com) for the incredibly awesome [Easy Digital Downloads](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/) plugin - without which this simple plugin would be useless.  Finally, to Andrew Munro, [Sumobi](http://sumobi.com/) who's plugin [EDD Coming Soon](http://sumobi.com/shop/edd-coming-soon/) provided an easy to follow roadmap for creating mine :) Thanks all!
